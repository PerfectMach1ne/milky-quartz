**Linux** is a clone of the operating system **Unix**, written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net. It aims towards **POSIX** and Single UNIX Specification compliance.

It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged **Unix**, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.

It is distributed under the **GNU General Public License v2** - see the accompanying COPYING file for more details.

Linux runs on a variety of hardware architectures, including:

- 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher)
- Most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures^1
