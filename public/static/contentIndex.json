In terms of command line toys, there’s docker build and docker buildx build which is like build on rails.\nDocker Buildx though is the client interface for building &amp; managing images, whereas Docker BuildKit is the server that does the heavy lifting including execution.\nBuilx’s build request to BuildKit includes the Dockerfile, build args and export and/or caching opts.\nExample Dockerfile\nFrom github.com/cloudnativedevops/demo.git.\nAnyways, here’s a very plain and simple Go HTTP server that runs on 127.0.0.1:8888:\npackage main\n \nimport (\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\n\t&quot;log&quot;\n\t&quot;net/http&quot;\n)\n \nfunc handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tfmt.Fprintln(w, &quot;Hello, 世界&quot;)\n}\n \nfunc main() {\n\thttp.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handler)\n\tfmt.Println(&quot;Running demo app. Press Ctrl+C to exit...&quot;)\n\tlog.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8888&quot;, nil))\n}\nNow here’s the Dockerfile\nFROM golang:1.17-alpine AS build\n \nWORKDIR /src/\nCOPY main.go go.* /src/\nRUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /bin/demo\n \nFROM scratch\nCOPY --from=build /bin/demo /bin/demo\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;/bin/demo&quot;]\nThen you run one of those1 to build and run at 127.0.0.1:9999:\ndocker image build -t myhello .\ndocker container run -p 9999:8888 myhello\n\n\n                  \n                  Caution \n                  \n                \n\nThe port syntax for docker run is HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT, so to access the container and receive the pretty “Hello, 世界” you refer to your host’s address with the first port you provided.\ncurl -v 127.0.0.1:9999\n\n\nInspect your image &amp; container (prints a JSON to stdout):\ndocker image inspect myhello\ndocker inspect myhello\ndocker container inspect c7112281a566\ndocker inspect c7112281a566\nAlso check if it’s running:\ndocker ps\ndocker container ls\n\n\n                  \n                  Container names \n                  \n                \n\nWhen you build an image, by default it just gets a hexadecimal ID, which you can use to refer to it later (for example, to run it). These IDs aren’t particularly memorable or easy to type, so Docker allows you to give the image a human-readable name, using the -t switch to docker image build. In the previous example you named the image myhello, so you should be able to use that name to run the image now.\n(Credit: writers of book from parent chapter’s repository)\n\n\nDocker Compose\nDocker, but on rails (featuring YAML from DevOps May Cry).\nFootnotes\n\n\nOf course, appending sudo to both commands in the case I’m still a silly GoobSec shellhead that doesn’t wanna create a Docker group. ↩\n\n\n"},"dockerfiles":{"title":"Dockerfile structure","links":["docker"],"tags":["Dockerfile","Docker","containers","term"],"content":"Dockerfiles\nFor little extras, also read up Docker basics"},"github":{"title":"GitHub","links":[],"tags":["GitHub","Git","repositories","term"],"content":"GitHub CLI reference\nGitHub web\n\n\n                  \n                  Remote repo editing \n                  \n                \n\nOpen a repository in browser, then click on a file and press the &lt;/&gt; key to open the github.dev VS Code browser editor!\n\n"},"index":{"title":"Milky Quartz on the catnet","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to milky-quartz.netcatcat.net ‼️\nMilky Quartz!

Typically an alert also has severity attached to it.\nOne of the best practices for setting up alerts is ensuring that all alerts are actionable:\n\nEvery alert should require human intervention and have a clear resolution path. If an alert is triggered but there’s nothing an engineer can do to resolve it, then it shouldn’t be an alert.\n\nMake sure rules are not too permissive nor aggressive to avoid alarm fatigue.\nAnother one is alerting symptoms rather than causes, e.g.:\n\n\n                  \n                  Recommended examples \n                  \n                \n\n\nAPI success rate below 99.9%\nPayment processing latency &gt; 10s\nError rate exceeded 5% in the last 5 mins\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Not recommended examples \n                  \n                \n\n\nHigh CPU usage on an API server\nNetwork packets received have increased\nLow disk space on server\n\n\n\nThe handling of situations from not recommended examples can often be automated with auto-scaling or failover mechanisms (if truly necessary).\nDashboard strategies\n\n\n                  \n                  USE method \n                  \n                \n\nFor monitoring infrastructure; best used for building dashboards that track hardware resources in infrastructure, such as CPU, memory, and network devices.
