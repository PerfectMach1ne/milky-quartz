# Raspberry Pi Zero W

## My little toy

`2025-01-30`: I have assembled it; the heatsink is attached and the microcomputer is inserted into the cover.\
I put the 16 GB microSD card into the adapter in order to install the OS. Will have to do that via MSI, as ASUS hadn't built into their caca laptop a port for it.
