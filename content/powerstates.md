# Notes on device power states

## Hibernation

Hibernation typically means the entire image of RAM memory is saved to the disk (whether SSD or HDD) and then the laptop is quote-on-quotes shut down.\
Some people claim that hibernation is not the best on Linux-based systems and for SSDs, but it really depends on the drive and distro. A healthy SSD with about 16-32GB or less of memory shouldn't suffer too much from hibernation. Hibernation issues on Linux are also rare (myself I've not run into any).
